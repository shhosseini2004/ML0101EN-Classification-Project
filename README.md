# ML0101EN-Classification-Project  
This repository contains the **Classification Project** from the ML0101EN course series. It demonstrates the application of supervised learning techniques to predict the presence of **heart disease** based on patient health parameters.

---

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build a classification model that predicts whether a patient is likely to have heart disease using clinical and physiological data.

---

## üß† Key Tasks
- Load and analyze the dataset (`heart.csv`)
- Standardize numeric features for model consistency
- Split data into training and test sets
- Train classification models:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - (Optional extensions: Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluate model performance using:
  - Accuracy  
  - F1-Score  
  - Jaccard Index  
  - Log Loss  
  - Confusion Matrix visualization
